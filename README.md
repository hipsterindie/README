- Hi, I’m @hipsterindie
- I’m interested in many things, some more than others. I enjoy making and listening to music, exercising now and then at the gym, playing video games, studying and learning about things that bring me joy.
- I've learned to use C# and C whilst studying for a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. I've also learned a few data stucture concepts and topics and hope to mess around with code in the future. I look forward to learning more about programming.
