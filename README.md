- Hi, I’m @hipsterindie
- I’m interested in many things, some more than others. But namely and plainly, I enjoy making and listening to music, exercising now and then at the gym, playing video games, studying and learning about things that bring me joy.
- I’m currently learning BASIC code (html, css) and hopefully more if I continue to enjoy it (python) to potentially help supplement my learning in pursuit of a Computer Engineering bachelor's degree.
